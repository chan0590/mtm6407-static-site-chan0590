        <h1>Hello. I'm Marco.</h1>
        <p>I recently graduated from the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College, where I focused on front-end development, UX design, and digital graphics. I enjoy creating user-centered websites - from concept and design to development, using tools like Illustrator, Photoshop and Figma, bringing them to life with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Before moving to Canada, I was part of the Key Account Management team at a German-based luxury packaging company in Hong Kong, managing well-known international brands accounts, navigating complex projects, and fulfilling their high expectations. These experiences and constant challenges taught me how to thrive under pressure, pay attention to every detail, anticipate client needs, and solve complex problems. In my free time, I enjoy photography, cooking, and travelling -and nothing beats a good BBQ with friends and family.</p>
