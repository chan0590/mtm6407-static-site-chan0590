    <p class="mb-6">
      I led the UX design for the Plant Palette feature, focusing on creating an intuitive flow that helps users browse, compare, and save plant combinations effortlessly. My work included user research, wireframing, and high-fidelity prototypes that clarified how gardeners can build palettes tailored to their space and style. The result is a smoother, more visual experience that supports confident decision-making.
